This software comes with a client and a server.

The server stores files and allows clients to retrieve data.

The client retrieves data, stores it locally, detects changes and uploads
changes to the server.

This works kinda like Dropbox, but different to suit my own needs. If you
happen to have the same needs, feel free to use this piece of software and
improve it maybe.
